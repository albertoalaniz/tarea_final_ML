abstract = "Assessing the impacts of forest harvest on biodiversity is a key mandate for demonstrating sustainable forest management in many jurisdictions, yet the identification of an appropriate suite of wildlife and habitat indicators remains a challenge. We used individual species-based modelling and a spatially extensive dataset of forest-dependent bird, amphibian, and mammal species to measure the strength of response and prominent patterns among taxa to variation in forest habitat conditions, ranging from understory site characteristics to landscape level patterns. Our findings revealed that understory habitat was a significant contributor to species relative abundance. Stand level features and climate were generally more important than disturbance or landscape patterns in affecting wildlife response. There was much variability among species in the specific habitat conditions and scales of importance, consistent with the inherent complexity and diversity of forest ecosystems. Our work highlights that setting targets and monitoring for a diverse range of wildlife and habitat indicators at multiple scales, including understory features, may be needed to adequately assess biodiversity response to sustainable forest management activities."

abstract = {An overlap in attributes of nest cavities used by Great Tit Parus major across Eurasia suggests similar nest site preferences within the geographical range, although the drivers of these preferences are unclear. To determine whether preferred cavities provide conditions enhancing successful reproduction, we investigated the breeding performance of Great Tits in relation to tree cavity characteristics using data collected during 2008–2011 in primeval conditions (Bia{\l}owie{\.{z}}a National Park, Poland). Here, tree cavities are diverse and superabundant but nesting birds are at risk from a variety of predators. According to expectations, nest losses were high (60 {\%} of Great Tit nests failed), mostly due to predation (69 {\%} of nest failures). The risk of nest failure varied with nest cavity attributes. Compared to successful nests, failures were situated higher above the ground and placed closer to the cavity entrance. Very deep cavities with narrow entrances and strong livings walls provided effective protection against larger predators (e.g., martens, woodpeckers), unable to enter the cavity or pull out the contents. Yet, such holes were no barrier for the smallest predators (e.g., Forest Dormouse Dryomys nitedula), which were able to enter any Great Tit nest cavity and destroyed most of the nests. Avoiding small predators would give a selective advantage to the birds, but this seems hardly possible to achieve. We conclude that tree cavities preferred by the tits show a combination of properties which are a compromise for avoiding predation (the strongest selective pressure) and providing the minimum requirements (sufficient nest illumination, microclimate, protection against nest soaking) for development and growth of young.},

abstract = {Abstract Aim Globally, many bird species nest in tree cavities that are either excavated or formed through decay or damage processes. We assembled an overview of all tree-cavity nesters (excavators and non-excavators) in the world, analysed their geographic distribution and listed the conservation status of all species. Location This is a global analysis of species from every continent except for Antarctica where the lack of trees precludes the occurrence of this group. Methods We reviewed the online version of the Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive, http://www.hbw.com/, and primary literature for species known to nest in tree cavities, with tree cavities defined as holes that a bird can enter such that it is not visible from the outside. We classified species by nester type (excavator or non-excavator, and obligate or facultative where possible), conservation threat status and zoogeographic region, and tested for statistical differences in species distributions across realms using chi-square tests. Results At least 1878 species (18.1{\%} of all bird species in the world) nest in tree cavities, of which we considered 355 to be primary excavators, 126 facultative excavators and 1357 non-excavators (we were unable to classify nesting type for 40 species). At least 338 species use cavities created by woodpeckers (Picidae), excluding reuse by woodpeckers themselves. About 13{\%} (249 species) of tree-cavity nesters experience major threats (i.e., status of vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered). The highest richness of tree-cavity nesters is found in the Neotropical (678 species) and Oriental (453) regions, and the highest proportion of threatened species in Australasia (17{\%}). Main conclusion Maintenance of a continual supply of cavities, a process in which woodpeckers and the processes of decay play critical roles, is a global conservation priority as tree cavities provide important nesting sites for many bird species.},

abstract = {Primary cavity-producers like woodpeckers are often considered as keystone species, because they produce nest-sites also for several other cavity-nesting animals and, thus, maintain ecological webs of cavity-breeders. However, the detailed temporal dynamics of cavities and their lifetime occupancy rates and survival are not usually known which makes it difficult to assess the actual significance and full impact of primary cavity-breeders. In this study, we monitored cavities in a large forest landscape, covering the full lifetime of cavities. We focused on a mature and old-growth forest specialist cavity-breeder, the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus. The data include the annual occupancy history of 655 old cavities of the Three-toed Woodpecker in 86 territories in a 170-km2 area in southern Finland during 1987–2017. The study area included both managed and natural forest types. The median survival time of a cavity was 10 years, but there were significant differences between forest area types with a range of 7–13 years. The occupancy in all cavities was 21.3{\%}, and the cavities were available for secondary cavity-breeders each year. There was a significant negative correlation between the occupancy and the age of the cavity. The first five years of a cavity were important for the total occupancy, and 86{\%} of occupancies took place before the median age of the cavities. In cavities older than 15 years the occupancy was only 7{\%}. The pattern was similar in all types of forests. Our results show that cavities made by Three-toed Woodpeckers have rather long lifespan but also that their active use by other cavity-breeding species is restricted mostly to few years only. The result indicates that new, fresh cavities are needed continuously in a forest landscape, in order to maintain the role that Three-toed Woodpecker has as a keystone species.},

Fungi facilitate cavity excavation by preparing and modifying excavation sites for cavity excavators. Associations between fungi and endangered red-cockaded woodpeckers (RCWs) are particularly interesting because these are the only birds that specialize in excavating into the heartwood of living pines, a process that takes years to complete. Using molecular methods, we examined fungal communities in complete and incomplete RCW excavations, and non-cavity control trees. In addition to finding a high diversity of fungi, we found three groupings of fungal communities corresponding to the three groups of trees sampled. We show that trees selected for cavity excavation by RCWs are infected by distinct fungal communities, and propose two hypotheses to explain this outcome: the bird facilitation hypothesis and the tree selection hypothesis.},

abstract = {Dead and decaying trees may be a limited resource for woodpeckers in managed forests, especially for species that rely on dead wood for nesting and foraging. Whereas recent nest web studies greatly increased our understanding of nest tree use by woodpeckers, knowledge on woodpeckers foraging requirements is much less developed. We quantified and compared tree selection patterns and foraging behavior of six bark-foraging woodpeckers – downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyropicus varius) and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) – that co-occur in eastern boreal forests of North America. A total of 271 observation bouts and more than 600 foraging trees were recorded at three study sites characterized as mixedwood, conifer, and burn. Our results show that dead wood represents an important foraging substrate for most bark-foraging woodpeckers in Canadian eastern boreal forests. However, significant differences in individual species were found with regard to substrate use patterns, foraging behavior and associated prey. Woodpeckers were categorized according to their selection for specific stages of tree degradation, with the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the pileated woodpecker representing opposite ends of this gradient. The black-backed woodpecker showed the highest use of dead wood and was very specific in its tree selection by using mostly recently dead trees. We emphasize that providing foraging substrates for most woodpecker species not only requires maintaining dead wood but also paying heed to the underlying dynamics of dead wood (e.g. recruitment and degradation) in managed boreal forest landscapes.},

abstract = {Abstract: We analyzed the usefulness of woodpecker species (??family Picidae) in predicting the diversity of other forest bird species using the Polish Ornithological Atlas data on species distribution in Poland. We used the database (n = 2317) to examine the patterns of woodpecker occurrence in atlas plots and to test how well the occurrence of woodpecker species is related to the occurrence of other forest birds. The occupancy of atlas plots by particular species varied from 98.5{\%} in the Great Spotted Woodpecker (???Dendrocopos major) to only 2.4{\%} in the Three-toed Woodpecker (???Picoides tridactylus). Woodpecker species richness in plots varied between 0 and 10 species, with a mean value of 4.3 species per plot. The occurrence of particular woodpecker species in plots with different woodpecker species richness was associated with the degree of specialization in particular species. Examining the entire data set, we found a positive relationship between woodpecker species richness and the number of species of other forest birds. These relationships were confirmed in three smaller regional data subsets with at least eight woodpecker species present (northeast Poland, r?2 = 0.78, p = 0.0001; east Poland, r?2 = 0.53, p = 0.0001; Carpathians, r?2 = 0.53, p = 0.0001). The mean number of forest specialists increased from 6 to over 30 species in plots with 0 and 9 woodpecker species, respectively. Also, the mean number of woodland generalists increased steadily with woodpecker species richness. Our results confirm the suitability of the woodpecker group as part of an indicator system for assessing avian diversity at the landscape scale. We suggest that in countries or regions in Europe where data on bird diversity are not readily available, woodpecker surveys could serve as a good tool for assessing the diversity of forest birds at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0901637106 Estimating actual and potential areas of distribution of species via ecological niche modeling has become a very active field of research, yet important conceptual issues in this field remain confused. We argue that conceptual clarity is enhanced by adopting restricted definitions of “niche” that enable operational definitions of basic concepts like fundamental, potential, and realized niches and potential and actual distributional areas. We apply these definitions to the question of niche conservatism, addressing what it is that is conserved and showing with a quantitative example how niche change can be measured. In this example, we display the extremely irregular structure of niche space, arguing that it is an important factor in understanding niche evolution. Many cases of apparently successful models of distributions ignore biotic factors: we suggest explanations to account for this paradox. Finally, relating the probability of observing a species to ecological factors, we address the issue of what objects are actually calculated by different niche modeling algorithms and stress the fact that methods that use only presence data calculate very different quantities than methods that use absence data. We conclude that the results of niche modeling exercises can be interpreted much better if the ecological and mathematical assumptions of the modeling process are made explicit.},

Specifically, we aim to account for the effects of trophic interactions at broad scales in ecological niche models (ENMs) of sea kraits (Laticauda: Reptilia) by including the potential distribution of food resources as predictor variables. Location: Oceania and Southeast Asia. Methods: First, we outline a simple method to generate biotic interaction variables for ENMs. We then test whether ENMs that include biotic interactions perform better than ENMs based on abiotic variables only. Results: The models based on biotic interactions (i.e. trophic interactions) and abiotic variables slightly outperformed the models informed only by abiotic variables. We found a strong relationship between prey species richness and probability of distribution of predator (sea kraits). The models that included potential distributions of prey species as predictor variables showed an increase in proportion of pixels predicted present and a decrease in omission error, compared with models based only on abiotic variables. Main conclusions: Distribution estimates of predator species at broad scales are more accurate if calibration of ENMs includes relevant biotic variables (prey species richness, in this study). Hence, when data are available, biotic variables should be included in ENMs.},

abstract = {Abstract Ecological niche models, or species distribution models, have been widely used to identify potentially suitable areas for species in future climate change scenarios. However, there are inherent errors to these models due to their inability to evaluate species occurrence influenced by non-climatic factors. With the intuit to improve the modelling predictions for a bromeliad-breeding treefrog (Phyllodytes melanomystax, Hylidae), we investigate how the climatic suitability of bromeliads influences the distribution model for the treefrog in the context of baseline and 2050 climate change scenarios. We used point occurrence data on the frog and the bromeliad (Vriesea procera, Bromeliaceae) to generate their predicted distributions based on baseline and 2050 climates. Using a consensus of five algorithms, we compared the accuracy of the models and the geographic predictions for the frog generated from two modelling procedures: (i) a climate-only model for P. melanomystax and V. procera; and (ii) a climate-biotic model for P. melanomystax, in which the climatic suitability of the bromeliad was jointly considered with the climatic variables. Both modelling approaches generated strong and similar predictive power for P. melanomystax, yet climate-biotic modelling generated more concise predictions, particularly for the year 2050. Specifically, because the predicted area of the bromeliad overlaps with the predictions for the treefrog in the baseline climate, both modelling approaches produce reasonable similar predicted areas for the anuran. Alternatively, due to the predicted loss of northern climatically suitable areas for the bromeliad by 2050, only the climate-biotic models provide evidence that northern populations of P. melanomystax will likely be negatively affected by 2050.},

Here, I summarize data on the social and breeding biology of this woodpecker, based on 22 active nests located from 1998-2002 in forests from northwestern Argentine Patagonia. Woodpeckers normally traveled in pairs or family parties. In late Austral winter, one to three cavities were selected for completion at each territory. Breeding occurred between mid- to late spring and early to mid-summer, and took about 65 days. Monogamous parents shared duties in nest excavation, incubation and young rearing. Egg length (± SD) measured 34.13 ± 0.79 mm and egg breadth 23.91 ± 0.67 mm, and incubation took roughly 20 days. Nestlings were altricial and remained at the nest for about 45 days. Clutch size was one, occasionally two eggs, and one nestling was produced at all successful nests. Young remained with their family group for up to 2 years or more, and were fed by adults, who normally bred every second year. Nest re-use, nest predation and helpers at the nest were not recorded. Holes were placed (± SD) 8.84 ± 3.71 m high and were 32.3 ± 5.32 cm deep. Entrances (± SD) were 8.92 ± 0.46 cm wide and 15.59 ± 2.54 cm high and mostly oval in shape. Peculiarities of the breeding biology and social behaviour of this species are discussed in the light of patterns common to picids, especially Campephilus spp. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

This study was aimed at exploring how evolutionary features of the vascular flora of Chile are distributed across the landscape. Using a phylogeny at the genus level for 87{\%} of the Chilean vascular flora, and a geographic database of sample localities, we calculated phylogenetic diversity (PD), phylogenetic endemism (PE), relative PD (RPD), and relative PE (RPE). Categorical Analyses of Neo- and Paleo-Endemism (CANAPE) were also performed, using a spatial randomization to assess statistical significance. A cluster analysis using range-weighted phylogenetic turnover was used to compare among grid cells, and with known Chilean bioclimates. PD patterns were concordant with known centers of high taxon richness and the Chilean biodiversity hotspot. In addition, several other interesting areas of concentration of evolutionary history were revealed as potential conservation targets. The south of the country shows areas of significantly high RPD and a concentration of paleo-endemism, and the north shows areas of significantly low PD and RPD, and a concentration of neo-endemism. Range-weighted phylogenetic turnover shows high congruence with the main macrobioclimates of Chile. Even though the study was done at the genus level, the outcome provides an accurate outline of phylogenetic patterns that can be filled in as more fine-scaled information becomes available.},

This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implica- tions for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies},

abstract = {ABSTRACT We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1 km2). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15{\%} (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

abstract = {Eucalyptus plantations have been established in many areas of the world due to their fast growth and profitability. In NW Spain, Eucalyptus plantations now cover a larger area than native forests. Although Eucalyptus plantations have been shown to affect biodiversity, relatively few studies have compared their effect on multiple taxonomic groups and different aspects of biodiversity. We compared herb and bird species richness and bird abundance between 14 paired patches of native deciduous forest and Eucalyptus plantations in a heterogeneous agro-forest region of NW Spain. We also investigated whether Eucalyptus plantations contribute to shifts in community composition by analysing species nestedness and turnover. We found that species richness of both herbs and birds was consistently lower in Eucalyptus plantations compared to native forests. Furthermore, the abundances of bird species characteristic of agricultural, forest, scrubland and other habitats, were all much lower in Eucalyptus plantations than in native forests. Herb and bird communities were also significantly dissimilar between the two habitats, but as a result of different ecological processes. Species turnover explained variation between habitats in herb composition, such that species present in native forests were typical for both farmland and forest habitats, whereas those present in Eucalyptus plantations were typical for scrub and farmland habitats. In contrast, bird assemblages showed a significant nested subset pattern, with fewer species in Eucalyptus plantations compared to native forests. In total, the relative abundance of cavity-nesting forest birds was at least 64{\%} higher in native forests. Our results show that Eucalyptus plantations cannot replace native forests as they harbour different herb species and only a subset of the bird species found in native forests. Considering the current rate of increase of Eucalyptus plantations and the fragmentation of native forests in NW Spain, a lack of conservation of native forests could result in future loss of biodiversity in general and forest specialist species in particular.},

abstract = {The expansion of forest plantations is cause for concern because of their environmental effects, and the loss of native forests and agricultural land. Our goal was to quantify the increase in pine plantation, and concomitant loss of native forests, in central Chile since ca. 1960, and to identify in which settings native forests were lost most rapidly. We analyzed aerial photographs from 1955 and 1961, Landsat images from 1975 and 1998, and Google Earth high-resolution satellite images from 2014. To ensure high classification accuracy, we visually interpreted images for a systematic 3-km grid and assigned each point as either ‘pine plantation', ‘native forest', ‘agricultural-livestock lands', or ‘other'. We also calculated latitude, longitude, slope, Euclidean distance to the nearest road and to the nearest pulp mill, and the frequency of land use surrounding each point as potential variables to explain observed land use changes. Pine plantations expansion started even before 1960, when 12{\%} of all points were already pine plantations, was particularly rapid from 1975 (18{\%} of sample points) to 1998 (38{\%}), and stabilized thereafter (37{\%} by 2014). From 1975 to 1998 alone, 40{\%} of native forests were replaced by pine plantations, and agricultural-livestock lands declined by 0.7{\%}, 0.9{\%}, 1{\%} per year before 1975, from 1975 to 1998, and after 1998 respectively. Native forests that were surrounded by pine plantations, were most likely to be converted to plantations, and from 1960 to 1975, also native forests near pulp mills. The probability of change from agricultural-livestock lands to pine plantations was mainly influenced by slope, with most agricultural-livestock lands remaining in areas with low slopes.},

abstract = {South American temperate rainforests, a global biodiversity hotspot, have been reduced to nearly 30{\%} of their original extent and most remaining stands are being degraded. Cavity-nesting vertebrate communities are dependent on cavity-bearing trees and hierarchically structured within nest webs. Evaluating the actual degree of cavity dependence (obligate, non-obligate) and the preferred attributes of trees by cavity nesters is critical to design conservation strategies in areas undergoing habitat loss. During three breeding seasons (2010–2013), we studied the cavity-nesting bird community in temperate rainforests of Chile. We found the highest reported proportion of tree cavity nesters (n = 29 species; 57{\%}) compared to non-cavity-using birds for any forest system. Four species were excavators and 25 were secondary cavity nesters (SCNs). Among SCNs, ten species were obligate and 15 were non-obligate cavity nesters. Seventy-five percent of nests of SCNs were located in cavities produced by tree decay processes and the remaining 25{\%} were in cavities excavated mainly by Pygarrhichas albogularis and Campephilus magellanicus. Nest web structure had a low dominance and evenness, with most network interactions occurring between SCNs and large decaying trees. Tree diameter at breast height (DBH) was larger in nest-trees (57.3 cm) than in available trees (26.1 cm). Cavity nesters showed a strong preference for dead trees, both standing and fallen (58{\%} of nests). Our results stress that retaining large decaying and standing dead trees (DBH {\textgreater} 57 cm), and large fallen trees, should be a priority for retention in forest management plans in this globally threatened ecosystem.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Springer Science+Business Media DordrechtContext: Interactions between landscape-scale processes and fine-grained habitat heterogeneity are usually invoked to explain species occupancy in fragmented landscapes. In variegated landscapes, however, organisms face continuous variation in micro-habitat features, which makes necessary to consider ecologically meaningful estimates of habitat quality at different spatial scales. Objectives: We evaluated the spatial scales at which forest cover and tree quality make the greatest contribution to the occupancy of the long-horned beetle Microplophorus magellanicus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in a variegated forest landscape. Methods: We used averaged data of tree quality (as derived from remote sensing estimates of the decay stage of single trees) and spatially independent pheromone-baited traps to model the occurrence probability as a function of multiple cross-scale combinations between forest cover and tree quality (with scales ranging between 50 and 400 m). Results: Model support and performance increased monotonically with the increasing scale at which tree quality was measured. Forest cover was not significant, and did not exhibit scale-specific effects on the occurrence probability of M. magellanicus. The interactive effect between tree quality and forest cover was stronger than the independent (additive) effects of tree quality and particularly forest cover. Significant interactions included tree quality measured at spatial scales ≥200 m, but cross-scale interactions occurred only in four of the seven best-supported models. Conclusions: M. magellanicus respond to the high-quality trees available in the landscape rather than to the amount of forest per se. Conservation of viable metapopulations of M. magellanicus should consider the quality of trees at spatial scales {\textgreater}200 m.},

@article{Suttidate2019,
abstract = {Biodiversity science and conservation alike require environmental indicators to understand species richness and predict species distribution patterns. The Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) are a set of three indices that summarize annual productivity measures from satellite data for biodiversity applications, and include: a) cumulative annual productivity; b) minimum annual productivity; and c) variation in annual productivity. At global scales and in temperate regions the DHIs predict species diversity patterns well, but the DHIs have not been tested in the tropics, where higher levels of productivity lead to the saturation of many remotely sensed vegetation indices. Our goal was to explain bird species richness patterns based on the DHIs in tropical areas. We related the DHIs to species richness of resident landbirds for five guilds (forest, scrub, grassland, generalist, and all resident birds) based on a) species distribution model (SDM) maps for 217 species, and b) range map for 564 species across Thailand. We also quantified the relative importance of the DHIs in multiple regression models that included two measures of topography, and two climate metrics using multiple regression, best-subsets, and hierarchical partitioning analyses. We found that the three DHIs alone explained forest bird richness best (R2adj 0.61 for both SDM- and rangemap based richness; 0.15–0.54 for the other guilds). When combining the DHIs with topography and climate, the richness of both forest birds and all resident bird species was equally well explained (R2adj 0.85 and 0.67 versus 0.81 and 0.68). Among the three DHIs, cumulative annual productivity had the greatest explanatory power for all guilds based on SDM richness maps (R2adj 0.54–0.61). The strong relationship between the DHIs and bird species richness in Thailand suggests that the DHIs capture energy availability well and are useful in biodiversity assessments and potentially bird conservation in tropical areas.},

@article{Biber2020,
abstract = {Abstract Aim Predicting future changes in species richness in response to climate change is one of the key challenges in biogeography and conservation ecology. Stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) are a commonly used tool to predict current and future species richness. Macroecological models (MEMs), regression models with species richness as response variable, are a less computationally intensive alternative to S-SDMs. Here, we aim to compare the results of two model types (S-SDMS and MEMs), for the first time for more than 14,000 species across multiple taxa globally, and to trace the uncertainty in future predictions back to the input data and modelling approach used. Location Global land, excluding Antarctica. Taxon Amphibians, birds and mammals. Methods We fitted S-SDMs and MEMs using a consistent set of bioclimatic variables and model algorithms and conducted species richness predictions under current and future conditions. For the latter, we used four general circulation models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0). Predicted species richness was compared between S-SDMs and MEMs and for current conditions also to extent-of-occurrence (EOO) species richness patterns. For future predictions, we quantified the variance in predicted species richness patterns explained by the choice of model type, model algorithm and GCM using hierarchical cluster analysis and variance partitioning. Results Under current conditions, species richness predictions from MEMs and S-SDMs were strongly correlated with EOO-based species richness. However, both model types over-predicted areas with low and under-predicted areas with high species richness. Outputs from MEMs and S-SDMs were also highly correlated among each other under current and future conditions. The variance between future predictions was mostly explained by model type. Main conclusions Both model types were able to reproduce EOO-based patterns in global terrestrial vertebrate richness, but produce less collinear predictions of future species richness. Model type by far contributes to most of the variation in the different future species richness predictions, indicating that the two model types should not be used interchangeably. Nevertheless, both model types have their justification, as MEMs can also include species with a restricted range, whereas S-SDMs are useful for looking at potential species-specific responses.},
